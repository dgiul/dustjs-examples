<!--

	Typically you'd want to compile a Dust.js template on the server, which turns it into a
	JS file, and that's the file you'd serve to the client rather than the raw tempalte file
		
	But what if you don't want to do it that way, and you want everything to happen on the client?
	That's what this example demonstrates
