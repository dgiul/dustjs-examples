dustjs-examples
===============

Basic (no, really, BASIC) examples of how to use Dust.js.

#### client-render.html
A basic example where the template is downloaded via ajax, compiled, loaded to the Dust.js cache, and then rendered to the DOM.

#### client-render-loop.html
Building on the client-render.html example, this one adds a tiny bit more complexity and adds multiple rows to a table from the same template file.

#### backbone.html
Building on the client-render-loop.html example, this one accomplishes the same thing, but adds Backbone.js and Underscore.js into the mix.
